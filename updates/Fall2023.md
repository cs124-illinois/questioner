# Fall 2023 Development Summary

Development summary for the second half of 2023 (July 1 - December 31, 2023) covering 121 commits with significant Kotlin changes.

## Major Architectural Changes

**Core Data Model Refactoring**: The `Question.kt` class underwent massive restructuring (~500 lines changed). The published question format was separated from the internal representation, with new `Published` and `Classification` data classes replacing embedded metadata.

**Template System Overhaul**: Language-specific templates moved from separate `javaTemplate`/`kotlinTemplate` fields to a unified `templateByLanguage` map, improving multi-language support.

**Solution Management**: The solution system was completely refactored - `correct` field replaced with `solutionByLanguage` map, and `incorrectExamples` replaced the `incorrect` list for better organization.

## New Features and Packages

**Stumpers Package**: Added a complete new package (`lib/src/main/kotlin/stumpers/`) with:
- Solution validation and cleaning utilities
- Bad word filtering
- Helper functions for solution processing

**Enhanced Testing Framework**: Major expansion of `TestTests.kt` (+322 lines) and `TestQuestion.kt` (+683 lines changed) with improved test generation and validation capabilities.

**Plugin System Redesign**:
- Removed `GenerateMetatests.kt` (-228 lines) and `SaveQuestions.kt` (-549 lines)
- Added `GenerateQuestionTests.kt` (+127 lines) and parser refactoring
- New parsing system with `ParseDirectory.kt` (+403 lines) and improved Java/Kotlin parsers

## Infrastructure Improvements

**Build System**: Upgraded Kotlin from 1.8.22 to 1.9.22, moved from JitPack to Maven Central publishing with proper artifact signing and publishing configuration.

**Server Integration**: Added MongoDB support, caching layer, and new data models for better question storage and retrieval.

**Validation Enhancements**: Significant improvements to `Validation.kt` (+381 lines changed) with better error handling and validation logic.

The changes represent a major version evolution focusing on better multi-language support, improved architecture separation, and enhanced tooling for question management and testing.
