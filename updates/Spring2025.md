# Spring 2025 Development Summary

Development summary for the first half of 2025 (January 1 - June 30, 2025) covering 20 commits focused primarily on maintenance, performance optimization, and dependency management.

## Dependency Modernization

**Major Version Updates**: Comprehensive dependency upgrades across the ecosystem:
- Kotlin 2.0.21 → 2.1.21 upgrade
- Kotlinter plugin 4.4.1 → 5.1.0
- KSP 2.0.21-1.0.26 → 2.1.21-2.0.1
- Version progression from 2024.11.0 to 2025.6.0
- Moshi, resource agent, and build tool updates

**Build System Refinements**: Updated multiple Gradle plugins and dependencies with careful version management to maintain compatibility while gaining performance improvements.

## Performance and Monitoring Enhancements

**Server Memory Management**: Enhanced server monitoring capabilities with:
- Memory usage tracking with percentage calculations
- Periodic heartbeat and memory check functionality
- Runtime memory reporting (total, free, used memory in MB)
- Improved garbage collection with generational GC experiments

**Logging Optimization**: Systematic logging verbosity reduction across components:
- Reduced server logging noise for production deployments
- Quieter operation while maintaining essential debugging capabilities
- Better log level management for different deployment scenarios

## Code Quality and Maintenance

**Parser Code Cleanup**: Refactored Java and Kotlin parsers with:
- Simplified method structures and reduced nesting
- Better code formatting and readability improvements
- Streamlined annotation processing logic
- Enhanced error handling in parser workflows

**Stumperd Refinements**: Minor improvements to the stumperd pipeline:
- Code style cleanup and formatting improvements
- Enhanced collection handling and deduplication logic
- Better MongoDB integration patterns
- Cleaner coroutine usage patterns

## Infrastructure Reliability

**Version Checking Improvements**: Enhanced version validation and compatibility checking to prevent deployment issues with mismatched component versions.

**Error Handling**: Better error suppression and warning management, including proper handling of deprecation warnings and build-time issues.

**Docker and Deployment**: Continued improvements to containerization and deployment processes, including memory allocator experimentation (jemalloc trials).

This period represents a consolidation phase focusing on system stability, performance optimization, and keeping the technology stack current while preparing for future feature development. The emphasis on dependency updates and monitoring improvements suggests preparation for increased production usage.
