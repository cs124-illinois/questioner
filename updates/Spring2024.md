# Spring 2024 Development Summary

Development summary for the first half of 2024 (January 1 - June 30, 2024) covering 50 commits with significant Kotlin changes.

## Major Infrastructure Improvements

**Settings and Configuration System**: Added new `Settings.kt` with environment-based configuration management, including concurrency controls, timeout settings, and resource allocation limits. Introduced dotenv support for flexible deployment configuration.

**Enhanced Plugin Architecture**: Major refactoring of `QuestionerPlugin.kt` (+297 lines) with improved dependency management, automatic plugin configuration, and better integration with code formatting tools (Google Java Format, Detekt, Kotlinter).

**Version Management**: Added comprehensive version checking with new `CheckQuestionerVersion.kt` and `Version.kt` tasks, ensuring compatibility across questioner installations and preventing version conflicts.

## New Features and Tools

**Question Management Tools**:
- Added `DumpQuestions.kt` (+90 lines) for analyzing publishable questions
- Added `ShowUpdatedSeeds.kt` (+31 lines) for tracking question seed changes
- Enhanced question collection and publishing workflows

**Common Files Support**: Extended Question data model to support `commonFiles` field, enabling shared resources across multiple question languages and improving code reuse.

**Server Improvements**: Streamlined server architecture by removing stumpers integration, enhancing caching mechanisms, and improving MongoDB integration with better error handling.

## Testing and Validation Enhancements

**Advanced Testing Framework**: Significant improvements to `TestTests.kt` (+401 lines) and `Validation.kt` (+317 lines) with:
- Better concurrency controls using semaphores
- Enhanced timeout management with wall-clock timeout multipliers
- Improved resource monitoring and allocation tracking
- More robust test generation and execution

**Parser Refinements**: Enhanced Java/Kotlin parsing in `ParseJava.kt` (+197 lines) and `ParseKotlin.kt` (+80 lines) with better error handling, improved annotation processing, and more accurate code analysis.

## Build System Modernization

**Automated Dependency Management**: Plugin now automatically adds questioner library dependencies and prevents conflicts, simplifying project setup and maintenance.

**Integrated Code Quality**: Seamless integration of code formatting and linting tools with proper task dependencies, ensuring consistent code quality across all questioner projects.

**Enhanced Test Integration**: Improved test generation workflow with better dependency management and more reliable test execution.

The changes represent focused improvements on developer experience, system reliability, and operational efficiency, building on the architectural foundations established in Fall 2023.
