# Fall 2024 Development Summary

Development summary for the second half of 2024 (July 1 - December 31, 2024) covering 103 commits with significant Kotlin changes.

## Major New Module: Stumperd

**Complete Stumperd System**: Added an entirely new standalone module (`stumperd/`) for mutation testing and deduplication with comprehensive functionality:
- Pipeline-based processing with `Pipeline.kt` (+79 lines)
- Core `Stumper.kt` data model (+115 lines) with step-based processing
- MongoDB integration for persistent storage
- Mutation, validation, and deduplication workflows
- Dedicated test suite with `TestPipeline.kt` (+128 lines)

**Stumpers Package Migration**: Removed the embedded stumpers package from lib (`-308 lines`) and migrated functionality to the dedicated stumperd module, improving separation of concerns and enabling independent deployment.

## Enhanced Testing Framework

**Advanced Test Testing**: Massive improvements to `TestTests.kt` (+281 lines) with:
- Enhanced mutation handling and validation logic
- Improved feature detection and analysis capabilities
- Better timeout management and resource monitoring
- Support for Kotlin compilation improvements

**Question Model Enhancements**: Significant updates to `Question.kt` (+129 lines) including:
- New import management for Java/Kotlin testing scenarios
- Enhanced testing configuration with timeout multipliers
- Extended metadata support with tags and versioning
- Improved test selection strategies including "EASIEST_AND_HARDEST"

## Infrastructure and Quality Improvements

**Modern Dependency Management**: Major version upgrades across the ecosystem:
- Kotlin 2.0.0 â†’ 2.2.0 upgrade
- KSP, Kotlinter, and build plugin updates
- Version bumped from 2024.7.0 to 2025.9.0

**Server Enhancements**: Improved server architecture with:
- Better coroutines integration and flow-based processing
- Enhanced logging and monitoring capabilities
- Improved submission handling and caching
- Better memory management and resource monitoring

**Code Quality Tools**: Added new verification utilities:
- Base64 encoding/decoding helpers in `verifiers/Common.kt`
- Enhanced parser improvements for Java/Kotlin processing
- Better error handling and validation logic

## Developer Experience

**Improved Testing Resources**: Multiple updates to test resources with refreshed timing and mutation data, ensuring more accurate and reliable testing scenarios.

**Enhanced Plugin System**: Continued improvements to the Gradle plugin with better version checking, dependency resolution, and build integration.

**Dotenv Modernization**: Refactored environment configuration to use modern dotenv APIs for better deployment flexibility and configuration management.

The changes represent a major evolution toward a more modular, scalable architecture with the introduction of dedicated services for specialized tasks while maintaining backward compatibility and improving overall system reliability.
